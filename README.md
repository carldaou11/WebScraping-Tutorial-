Web Scraping for beginners

Web scraping, also referred to as web data extraction, involves the automated extraction of data from websites. It eliminates the need for manual data extraction by employing intelligent automation to retrieve a vast amount of information from the expansive realm of the internet. 
In contrast, web crawling is the process employed by search engines to systematically browse and index websites. Before search engines can effectively deliver relevant pages in response to user queries, web crawlers explore the internet, gathering data from various pages and storing it for future search queries.
